/* Since item 3 and 4 shared 24px we could have recicle that code. will commit the fix
Â¡No need for calling both classes on item 2!, thats crucial for better understanding of classes and attributes.
Since most of the time you would have a lot of code and distribute it into more classes to elements is 
simpler and wont crump up the code too much and would keep the site responsive and better organized
since classes are per structure basis.
is explained really well in the 03-ex readme*/
